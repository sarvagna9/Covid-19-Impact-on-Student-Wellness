# Covid-19-Impact-on-Student-Wellness

We analyzed how Covid-19 affected high schoolers and their wellness, particularly high schoolersâ€™ access to extracurricular activities. Because track and field is a well-measurable extracurricular activity and has data that we can analyze over multiple years, we selected this sport to determine how Covid-19 affected high school track and field athletes. 

To begin this research, we gathered a large amount of track and field data from Athletic.net. We took 1600 meter running times from 2016-2023 in the states of California, Texas, New York, and Michigan. We utilized graphical representations of all the data and analyzed how running times were affected under different conditions.

The different conditions we analyzed are as follows: urban vs rural counties of CA, strict state (NY) vs lenient state (TX) on Covid-19 policies, hot (TX) vs cold (MI) state, and outdoor vs indoor track in MI.
